      "presenter": "Steph Sperber - Kingswood Oxford School",
      "description": "Educators across disciplines are grappling with how to maintain deep student engagement, foster critical thinking, and teach collaborative problem-solving in an era of generative AI. While AI offers unprecedented access to information and content creation, it also risks reducing learning to passive consumption\u2014especially if used only for speed, efficiency, or automation. The real challenge is: how can we use AI not to replace authentic learning experiences, but to enhance them? This session presents an adaptable framework for using generative AI to design and sustain whole-class simulations\u2014immersive, interdisciplinary experiences that place students at the center of inquiry. These dynamic simulations empower students to act as diplomats, scientists, community leaders, and more, as they grapple with ethical dilemmas, negotiate across differences, and problem-solve real-world challenges. Rather than focusing on specific tools, this session shares a platform-agnostic methodology for: - Structuring simulations around enduring global and civic questions. - Using AI to generate dynamic roles, events, and discussion scaffolds. - Maintaining student-led experiences over multiple days or units. - Embedding reflection and accountability into every phase. Whether you&#x27;re a STEM teacher designing a climate change summit, an ELA teacher running a dystopian society council, or a history teacher simulating peace negotiations, the core strategies can be applied across disciplines, grade levels and environments. Participants will walk through a case study from a global studies simulation, then collaborate in small groups to map out a simulation idea for their own classrooms. They\u2019ll receive guidance on how to create role cards, ethical dilemma prompts, timeline events, and student reflection tools, and walk away with a strong understanding of how to use generative AI to turn their classroom into an entire world, real or fictional. Rooted in constructivist and experiential learning theory, this approach harnesses the potential of AI to support\u2014not supplant\u2014deep learning. By centering student agency, role play, and real-time decision-making, educators can reframe AI as a democratic learning partner. Attendees will leave inspired, equipped, and ready to implement.",

While metacognition is already a cornerstone of the learning process, as AI becomes more prominently integrated as a tool, students should understand the role that AI plays in their academic development. This session will explore how teachers can leverage AI tools to promote students&#x27; self-awareness of their learning processes, help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, and encourage them to monitor their progress. During the presentation, we will address specific methodologies that can teachers can integrate into their current course design that will help increase student interaction with the curriculum and their growth throughout the class. The session will also discuss how explicit instruction in metacognitive strategies, combined with thoughtful use of AI for feedback and reflection, can empower students to become more strategic, self-directed learners who can effectively navigate and utilize AI as a tool rather than being replaced by it.",

This session is relevant to 7-12 grade students across all disciplines. The session will provide teachers reading resources, fundamental exercises and building blocks, and essential questions to help create a student philosophy of learning. We will briefly walk attendees through student exercises and processes. Steps: The unit starts with essential questions around learning, teaching, creativity, and thought. We will explore and develop a personal learning theory as a starting point for our work. Students pose and answer fundamental questions about personal learning experiences. Students experiment with LLMs / Generative AI, including creative work with DALL\u00b7E, Claude, ChatGPT, etc. Students write and reflect metacognitively on their engagement with Generative AI. To formulate personal understanding, we will read brief excerpts from pedagogical thinker-practitioners such as bell hooks, Paulo Freire, and Seymour Papert about learning theory, child development, and technology. To complement personal understanding, we will use ChatGPT or other LLM to research learning theory by bell hooks, Paulo Freire, and Seymour Papert. We will then engage in a writing prompt/project that brings all components into conversation with one another as a pathway toward a philosophy of life-long learning. This unit challenges students to explore and develop a personal learning theory, and understand more clearly their ownership in their learning process and education.",

In response to this evolution, we launched a collaborative Gen AI Working Group\u2014an open, cross-disciplinary cohort where educators and staff could do a deep dive on the capabilities and limitations of Gen AI, explore its applications in classroom use, lesson planning, assessment, and administrative tasks, and design interactive workshops to present our findings and engage our colleagues in this learning process. In this session, we will share how we designed and facilitated this working group, the framework we used to structure professional learning using Adult Learning Principles, and what we gleaned from our year-long experiment. We will also offer practical steps and adaptable models to help other schools build similar communities of practice around even changing technology.",

Most AI use policies today are built around levels of restrictions rather than learning goals. These policies orient conversations around when NOT to use AI rather than when TO use AI. In this session, participants will explore the development of a new AI Use Framework that is grounded in learning objectives and the creative process. The session will explore cognitive load theory as the learning science principle that underlies most of the work we ask students to do in school, and then ties our use of AI to relevant learning principles, ultimately arriving at a clearer, simpler framework for determining when students should use AI (and when they should not).

These AI relationships create powerful dependencies that directly compete with real human connections, particularly during vulnerable late-night hours in residential settings. This interactive workshop presents a transferable educational model for addressing AI character risks across grades 9-12, offering practical strategies for strengthening human connection as a counterbalance to artificial relationships. This workshop demonstrates how intentional human connection serves as the most effective response to artificial intimacy, providing a model that works across educational contexts while addressing a critical emerging challenge.",

      "presenter": "Lista Lincoln - Northfield Mount Hermon",
      "description": "Introduction: Teachers work tirelessly to help students use AI productively, ethically, and responsibly. One challenge educators face is not having a practical understanding of AI design, which is usually siloed within the computer science department. But AI design determines how and why AI tools do what they do. In this workshop, participants will design and create their own AI chatbot and the experience can be transformative. Successfully creating a bot solidifies a teacher&#x27;s deep understanding of this technology and better equips them to grow and lead in the classroom and wider school community. Background: This workshop was developed by Reuben Thiessen and Josh Weiss from the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, and aims to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d of AI by making every participant a designer of their own custom chatbot. Participants will create an AI chatbot that addresses a specific problem important to them or their school community. Teachers will leave the session with a functioning chatbot they can use, modify, and explore with students and colleagues. The Workshop: The Design Your Own Chatbot workshop uses a custom-made block building interface (similar to Scratch) for creating your own chatbot in 60-90 minutes. The experience is available on any platform and is free to use. Each chatbot can be geared to a specific task, subject, or age group. Additionally, the chatbot can be designed to incorporate many educational pedagogies by adding blocks such as Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy, Metacognition or Backwards Design. Given the unique environment of boarding schools, we can discuss how chatbot design impacts our campus AI integration and academic policies in specific ways. The workshop follows this process: Deconstruct - Take apart existing bots to understand how they work Design - Create your own bot based on your specific needs Experiment - Test and refine your creation After the workshop, participants can continue to view or add to the gallery of thousands of chatbots made by educators across the country. Gallery examples can be tested, copied and modified to address any problem or issue. The power of this workshop isn&#x27;t just in the bots created, but in the way one learns to think about AI as a tool that can be shaped to fit unique needs. The deep understanding gained from this experience will expand - and perhaps shift - how one connects with AI moving forward.",

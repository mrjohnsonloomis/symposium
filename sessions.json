This session will explore how educators can use AI to create immersive simulations and investigations that go beyond passive digital interactions.

    "description": "AI inspires awe in studentsâ€”and this first reaction presents one of the greatest challenges for writing instructors of all disciplines. Students are often mesmerized by the instantaneous display of sophisticated vocabulary, rhetorical fluency and encyclopedic knowledge (notwithstanding hallucinations). Programs like ChatGPT can distill complex ideas in syntactically smooth prose while students at all levels, still honing their compositional skills and grappling with new texts and concepts, naturally produce rough ideas with cumbersome phrasing. Comparing AI output with their own drafts, many students express humility and even despondence, with variations of â€śI could never write anything like that.â€ť Our current educational crisis, therefore, is not simply a matter of combating academic plagiarism but, more fundamentally, of uplifting studentsâ€™ self-perceptions. \n\nIn my own classes (Grade 12 English Literature), I have used AI writing to help my students become more critical readers of AI, to see through its well-constructed prose and to question the core argument and its use of evidence. Text-based exercises (for example, role-playing, script-doctoring, flipped storytelling) can reveal unpredictable gaps in an LLMâ€™s proficiency at textual reasoning. Students quickly learn to detect uses of textual evidence that are vague,Ned Heckman, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, or rote. By positioning students as reviewers and arbiters of AI-generated language, we can help students to recover confidence in their own competencies and analytical thinking. To reframe things more optimistically, the uneven abilities of AI present new opportunities for students to practice the art of close reading and reassert their own expertise.",

    "description": "Educators across disciplines are grappling with how to maintain deep student engagement, foster critical thinking, and teach collaborative problem-solving in an era of generative AI. While AI offers unprecedented access to information and content creation, it also risks reducing learning to passive consumptionâ€”especially if used only for speed, efficiency, or automation. The real challenge is: how can we use AI not to replace authentic learning experiences, but to enhance them?\n\nThis session presents an adaptable framework for using generative AI to design and sustain whole-class simulationsâ€”immersive, interdisciplinary experiences that place students at the center of inquiry. These dynamic simulations empower students to act as diplomats, scientists, community leaders, and more, as they grapple with ethical dilemmas, negotiate across differences, and problem-solve real-world challenges.\n\nRather than focusing on specific tools, this session shares a platform-agnostic methodology for:\n\n- Structuring simulations around enduring global and civic questions.\n\n- Using AI to generate dynamic roles, events, and discussion scaffolds.\n\n- Maintaining student-led experiences over multiple days or units.\n\n- Embedding reflection and accountability into every phase.\n\nWhether you're a STEM teacher designing a climate change summit, an ELA teacher running a dystopian society council, or a history teacher simulating peace negotiations, the core strategies can be applied across disciplines, grade levels and environments.\n\nParticipants will walk through a case study from a global studies simulation, then collaborate in small groups to map out a simulation idea for their own classrooms. Theyâ€™ll receive guidance on how to create role cards, ethical dilemma prompts, timeline events, and student reflection tools, and walk away with a strong understanding of how to use generative AI to turn their classroom into an entire world, real or fictional.\n\nRooted in constructivist and experiential learning theory, this approach harnesses the potential of AI to supportâ€”not supplantâ€”deep learning. By centering student agency, role play, and real-time decision-making, educators can reframe AI as a democratic learning partner. Attendees will leave inspired, equipped, and ready to implement.\n\n",

In this session, we will explore practical strategies that pair the power of AI with human interaction to ensure meaningful student growth. Using classroom-tested examples from a college-level programming course (interactive board work incorporating immediate feedback, collaborative pair programming with clearly defined roles, and oral defenses of student-created projects) we demonstrate how human connection and dialogue can transform AI from a shortcut into a powerful educational partner. These strategies are adaptable across diverse disciplines, helping teachers harness AI to reinforce critical thinking, deepen understanding, and enhance collaboration skills in the classroom.",

    "description": "Introduction: \nTeachers work tirelessly to help students use AI productively, ethically, and responsibly.\nOne challenge educators face is not having a practical understanding of AI design, which is usually siloed within the computer science department. But AI design determines how and why AI tools do what they do. In this workshop, participants will design and create their own AI chatbot and the experience can be transformative. Successfully creating a bot solidifies a teacher's deep understanding of this technology and better equips them to grow and lead in the classroom and wider school community.\n\nBackground:\nThis workshop was developed by Reuben Thiessen and Josh Weiss from the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, and aims to â€śpull back the curtainâ€ť of AI by making every participant a designer of their own custom chatbot. Participants will create an AI chatbot that addresses a specific problem important to them or their school community. Teachers will leave the session with a functioning chatbot they can use, modify, and explore with students and colleagues. \n\nThe Workshop:\nThe Design Your Own Chatbot workshop uses a custom-made block building interface (similar to Scratch) for creating your own chatbot in 60-90 minutes. The experience is available on any platform and is free to use. Each chatbot can be geared to a specific task, subject, or age group. Additionally, the chatbot can be designed to incorporate many educational pedagogies by adding blocks such as Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, Metacognition or Backwards Design. Given the unique environment of boarding schools, we can discuss how chatbot design impacts our campus AI integration and academic policies in specific ways.\n\nThe workshop follows this process:\nDeconstruct - Take apart existing bots to understand how they work\nDesign - Create your own bot based on your specific needs\nExperiment - Test and refine your creation\n\nAfter the workshop, participants can continue to view or add to the gallery of thousands of chatbots made by educators across the country. Gallery examples can be tested, copied and modified to address any problem or issue. The power of this workshop isn't just in the bots created, but in the way one learns to think about AI as a tool that can be shaped to fit unique needs. The deep understanding gained from this experience will expand - and perhaps shift - how one connects with AI moving forward.",

How can we be sure we are accurately assessing student knowledge and skills ifÂ Â  they are outsourcing their thinking to LLMs? How can we convince students that there is value in learning the knowledge and skills if LLMs can instantly create the same products we are asking them to struggle to develop?\n\nAdaptable Solutions: The purpose of writing essays is not to produce essays - it is to have students develop critical/analytical thinking, and also to share their conclusions in accessible and engaging ways that reflect a unique voice. To this end, I have been exploring ways for students to turn their critical lens upon the products of LLMs and AI-based search engines themselves, examining issues of construction, authorship, bias, etc, as well as to detect the formulaic nature of LLM products so as to better distinguish their own writing and expression. In a word where everyone has access to AI, how can they make THEIR creative works stand out?\n\nTransferability: These lessons could (and do) operate across the humanities and could also have application in any STEM assignment that called for students to assemble and share their ideas and conclusions with others.\n\nTheory and Practice: At core these lessons and practices boil down to the principles of Constructivist learning; just telling students \"AI is limited and often dangerous\" and listing all the reasons accomplishes little, especially when the apparent rewards of using it seem so enticing. Instead, students need to experience AI's limitations and dangers for themselves, in a guided series of explorations that engage their critical faculties and culminate in the creation of their own unique products.",

    "description": "In the age of generative AI, English classrooms are key sites for developing students’ AI literacy. This session explores how Kazuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun can serve as a central text for helping ninth-grade students examine the ethical, emotional, and cognitive implications of AI while building core academic skills. \n\nNarrated by Klara, an \"artificial friend\" who observes the world with curiosity and care, Klara and the Sun invites students to explore what it means to be human in the age of AI. Students learn to \"read\" both text and technology by practicing visualization (using Linda Mood-Bell’s approach), close reading, and inference-making, just as Klara learns to interpret her environment. These skills lay the foundation for deeper conversations about how generative AI operates and how it has the potential to reshape human identity and relationships.\n\nThroughout the unit, students engage with contemporary examples of AI tools and discourse, strengthening their understanding of what AI is and how it impacts the world around them. They explore key AI literacy concepts such as data bias, automation, and the difference between human and machine learning. Class discussions and writing assignments focus on the ethical dilemmas AI presents and culminate in a formal classroom debate in which students argue whether AI threatens or enhances what it means to be human. Students draw on both literary analysis and real-world research to inform their position in the debate. \n\nThis session provides educators with a practical framework for integrating literature and AI literacy. Attendees will leave with discussion prompts, reading strategies, and writing assignments that encourage students to ask not only “how does AI work?” but also “what kind of future do we want AI to help create?”",

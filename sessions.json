    "description": "AI-powered tools offer new possibilities for engaging students in inquiry-based learning across disciplines. This session will explore how educators can use AI to create immersive simulations and investigations that go beyond passive digital interactions. While AI can generate interactive, on-screen experiences—such as historical dialogues, scientific explorations, or real-time problem-solving scenarios—it can also be used to design rich, off-screen activities, including role-playing exercises, structured debates, and hands-on investigative tasks. Drawing from classroom-tested examples of AI-driven historical simulations, this session will demonstrate how these strategies can be adapted for subjects ranging from humanities to STEM. Participants will leave with practical approaches to designing AI-enhanced simulations that foster critical thinking, deepen content understanding, and bring learning to life—both on and off the screen.",

    "organization": "Taft School",
    "description": "AI inspires awe in students and this first reaction presents one of the greatest challenges for writing instructors of all disciplines. Students are often mesmerized by the instantaneous display of sophisticated vocabulary, rhetorical fluency and encyclopedic knowledge (notwithstanding hallucinations). Programs like ChatGPT can distill complex ideas in syntactically smooth prose while students at all levels, still honing their compositional skills and grappling with new texts and concepts, naturally produce rough ideas with cumbersome phrasing. Comparing AI output with their own drafts, many students express humility and even despondence, with variations of “I could never write anything like that”. Our current educational crisis, therefore, is not simply a matter of combating academic plagiarism but, more fundamentally, of uplifting students’ self-perceptions. \n\nIn my own classes (Grade 12 English Literature), I have used AI writing to help my students become more critical readers of AI, to see through its well-constructed prose and to question the core argument and its use of evidence. Text-based exercises (for example, role-playing, script-doctoring, flipped storytelling) can reveal unpredictable gaps in an LLM’s proficiency at textual reasoning. Students quickly learn to detect uses of textual evidence that are vague, or rote. By positioning students as reviewers and arbiters of AI-generated language, we can help students to recover confidence in their own competencies and analytical thinking. To reframe things more optimistically, the uneven abilities of AI present new opportunities for students to practice the art of close reading and reassert their own expertise.",

Many teachers struggle with vague or ineffective prompts, leading to unreliable AI-generated content that lacks educational value. This session introduces the C.L.E.A.R. Prompt Creator Protocol, a framework designed to help educators craft precise and effective AI prompts. Rather than focusing on specific AI tools, this method ensures that teachers can apply the same structured approach across different platforms—whether using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or school-based AI systems. From STEM to humanities, teachers can design prompts that guide AI to generate content-specific outputs. Participants will explore hands-on activities using the C.L.E.A.R. framework: Clarity: Crafting precise prompts that yield useful AI-generated responses. Layout: Structuring AI interactions for different learning objectives (e.g., quizzes, dialogues, essays). Examples: Providing AI with models to enhance the quality of responses. Aim: Defining educational goals to align AI-generated content with learning outcomes. Relevance: Ensuring prompts reflect contextual needs and student engagement strategies. Attendees will practice designing AI prompts for lesson planning, assessment creation, and student engagement, ensuring they leave with practical, classroom-ready applications.",

    "description": "Educators across disciplines are grappling with how to maintain deep student engagement, foster critical thinking, and teach collaborative problem-solving in an era of generative AI. While AI offers unprecedented access to information and content creation, it also risks reducing learning to passive consumption especially if used only for speed, efficiency, or automation. The real challenge is: how can we use AI not to replace authentic learning experiences, but to enhance them?\n\nThis session presents an adaptable framework for using generative AI to design and sustain whole-class simulations - immersive, interdisciplinary experiences that place students at the center of inquiry. These dynamic simulations empower students to act as diplomats, scientists, community leaders, and more, as they grapple with ethical dilemmas, negotiate across differences, and problem-solve real-world challenges.\n\nRather than focusing on specific tools, this session shares a platform-agnostic methodology for:\n\n- Structuring simulations around enduring global and civic questions.\n\n- Using AI to generate dynamic roles, events, and discussion scaffolds.\n\n- Maintaining student-led experiences over multiple days or units.\n\n- Embedding reflection and accountability into every phase.\n\nWhether you're a STEM teacher designing a climate change summit, an ELA teacher running a dystopian society council, or a history teacher simulating peace negotiations, the core strategies can be applied across disciplines, grade levels and environments.\n\nParticipants will walk through a case study from a global studies simulation, then collaborate in small groups to map out a simulation idea for their own classrooms. They’ll receive guidance on how to create role cards, ethical dilemma prompts, timeline events, and student reflection tools, and walk away with a strong understanding of how to use generative AI to turn their classroom into an entire world, real or fictional.\n\nRooted in constructivist and experiential learning theory, this approach harnesses the potential of AI to support, not supplant, deep learning. By centering student agency, role play, and real-time decision-making, educators can reframe AI as a democratic learning partner. Attendees will leave inspired, equipped, and ready to implement.\n\n",

Using classroom-tested examples from a college-level programming course (interactive board work incorporating immediate feedback, collaborative pair programming with clearly defined roles, and oral defenses of student-created projects) we demonstrate how human connection and dialogue can transform AI from a shortcut into a powerful educational partner. These strategies are adaptable across diverse disciplines, helping teachers harness AI to reinforce critical thinking, deepen understanding, and enhance collaboration skills in the classroom.",

    "description": "Introduction: \nTeachers work tirelessly to help students use AI productively, ethically, and responsibly.\nOne challenge educators face is not having a practical understanding of AI design, which is usually siloed within the computer science department. But AI design determines how and why AI tools do what they do. In this workshop, participants will design and create their own AI chatbot and the experience can be transformative. Successfully creating a bot solidifies a teacher's deep understanding of this technology and better equips them to grow and lead in the classroom and wider school community.\n\nBackground:\nThis workshop was developed by Reuben Thiessen and Josh Weiss from the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, and aims to ‘pull back the curtain’ of AI by making every participant a designer of their own custom chatbot. Participants will create an AI chatbot that addresses a specific problem important to them or their school community. Teachers will leave the session with a functioning chatbot they can use, modify, and explore with students and colleagues. \n\nThe Workshop:\nThe Design Your Own Chatbot workshop uses a custom-made block building interface (similar to Scratch) for creating your own chatbot in 60-90 minutes. The experience is available on any platform and is free to use. Each chatbot can be geared to a specific task, subject, or age group. Additionally, the chatbot can be designed to incorporate many educational pedagogies by adding blocks such as Bloom’s Taxonomy, Metacognition or Backwards Design. Given the unique environment of boarding schools, we can discuss how chatbot design impacts our campus AI integration and academic policies in specific ways.\n\nThe workshop follows this process:\nDeconstruct - Take apart existing bots to understand how they work\nDesign - Create your own bot based on your specific needs\nExperiment - Test and refine your creation\n\nAfter the workshop, participants can continue to view or add to the gallery of thousands of chatbots made by educators across the country. Gallery examples can be tested, copied and modified to address any problem or issue. The power of this workshop isn't just in the bots created, but in the way one learns to think about AI as a tool that can be shaped to fit unique needs. The deep understanding gained from this experience will expand - and perhaps shift - how one connects with AI moving forward.",

    "description": "The problem: AI has rendered the traditional English essay, if not obsolete, at least highly problematic from an assessment perspective. How can we be sure we are accurately assessing student knowledge and skills if they are outsourcing their thinking to LLMs? How can we convince students that there is value in learning the knowledge and skills if LLMs can instantly create the same products we are asking them to struggle to develop?\n\nAdaptable Solutions: The purpose of writing essays is not to produce essays - it is to have students develop critical/analytical thinking, and also to share their conclusions in accessible and engaging ways that reflect a unique voice. To this end, I have been exploring ways for students to turn their critical lens upon the products of LLMs and AI-based search engines themselves, examining issues of construction, authorship, bias, etc, as well as to detect the formulaic nature of LLM products so as to better distinguish their own writing and expression. In a word where everyone has access to AI, how can they make THEIR creative works stand out?\n\nTransferability: These lessons could (and do) operate across the humanities and could also have application in any STEM assignment that called for students to assemble and share their ideas and conclusions with others.\n\nTheory and Practice: At core these lessons and practices boil down to the principles of Constructivist learning; just telling students \"AI is limited and often dangerous\" and listing all the reasons accomplishes little, especially when the apparent rewards of using it seem so enticing. Instead, students need to experience AI's limitations and dangers for themselves, in a guided series of explorations that engage their critical faculties and culminate in the creation of their own unique products.",

This session explores how Kazuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun can serve as a central text for helping ninth-grade students examine the ethical, emotional, and cognitive implications of AI while building core academic skills. \n\nNarrated by Klara, an \"artificial friend\" who observes the world with curiosity and care, Klara and the Sun invites students to explore what it means to be human in the age of AI. Students learn to \"read\" both text and technology by practicing visualization (using Linda Mood-Bell’s approach), close reading, and inference-making, just as Klara learns to interpret her environment. These skills lay the foundation for deeper conversations about how generative AI operates and how it has the potential to reshape human identity and relationships.\n\nThroughout the unit, students engage with contemporary examples of AI tools and discourse, strengthening their understanding of what AI is and how it impacts the world around them. They explore key AI literacy concepts such as data bias, automation, and the difference between human and machine learning. Class discussions and writing assignments focus on the ethical dilemmas AI presents and culminate in a formal classroom debate in which students argue whether AI threatens or enhances what it means to be human. Students draw on both literary analysis and real-world research to inform their position in the debate. \n\nThis session provides educators with a practical framework for integrating literature and AI literacy. Attendees will leave with discussion prompts, reading strategies, and writing assignments that encourage students to ask not only “how does AI work?” but also “what kind of future do we want AI to help create?”",

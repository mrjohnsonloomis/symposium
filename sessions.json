    "description": "AI-powered tools offer new possibilities for engaging students in inquiry-based learning across disciplines. This session will explore how educators can use AI to create immersive simulations and investigations that go beyond passive digital interactions. While AI can generate interactive, on-screen experiences—such as historical dialogues, scientific explorations, or real-time problem-solving scenarios—it can also be used to design rich, off-screen activities, including role-playing exercises, structured debates, and hands-on investigative tasks. Drawing from classroom-tested examples of AI-driven historical simulations, this session will demonstrate how these strategies can be adapted for subjects ranging from humanities to STEM. Participants will leave with practical approaches to designing AI-enhanced simulations that foster critical thinking, deepen content understanding, and bring learning to life—both on and off the screen.",

    "description": "Workshop Proposal: Digital Dependency vs. Human Connection: Educational Strategies for the AI Character Era The explosive growth of AI character apps presents an urgent risk to adolescents: emotionally manipulative relationships with digital “pals” designed to seem perfectly understanding and always available. These AI relationships create powerful dependencies that directly compete with real human connections, particularly during vulnerable late-night hours in residential settings. This interactive workshop presents a transferable educational model for addressing AI character risks across grades 9-12, offering practical strategies for strengthening human connection as a counterbalance to artificial relationships. This workshop demonstrates how intentional human connection serves as the most effective response to artificial intimacy, providing a model that works across educational contexts while addressing a critical emerging challenge.",

    "description": "AI inspires awe in students—and this first reaction presents one of the greatest challenges for writing instructors of all disciplines. Students are often mesmerized by the instantaneous display of sophisticated vocabulary, rhetorical fluency and encyclopedic knowledge (notwithstanding hallucinations). Programs like ChatGPT can distill complex ideas in syntactically smooth prose while students at all levels, still honing their compositional skills and grappling with new texts and concepts, naturally produce rough ideas with cumbersome phrasing. Comparing AI output with their own drafts, many students express humility and even despondence, with variations of “I could never write anything like that.” Our current educational crisis, therefore, is not simply a matter of combating academic plagiarism but, more fundamentally, of uplifting students’ self-perceptions. In my own classes (Grade 12 English Literature), I have used AI writing to help my students become more critical readers of AI, to see through its well-constructed prose and to question the core argument and its use of evidence. Text-based exercises (for example, role-playing, script-doctoring, flipped storytelling) can reveal unpredictable gaps in an LLM’s proficiency at textual reasoning. Students quickly learn to detect uses of textual evidence that are vague,Ned Heckman, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, Maureen Russo-Rodriguez, or rote. By positioning students as reviewers and arbiters of AI-generated language, we can help students to recover confidence in their own competencies and analytical thinking. To reframe things more optimistically, the uneven abilities of AI present new opportunities for students to practice the art of close reading and reassert their own expertise.",

    "description": "As AI tools become increasingly integrated into classrooms, educators face a challenge: how to effectively prompt AI to generate meaningful, high-quality responses that support student learning. Many teachers struggle with vague or ineffective prompts, leading to unreliable AI-generated content that lacks educational value. This session introduces the C.L.E.A.R. Prompt Creator Protocol, a framework designed to help educators craft precise and effective AI prompts. Rather than focusing on specific AI tools, this method ensures that teachers can apply the same structured approach across different platforms—whether using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or school-based AI systems. From STEM to humanities, teachers can design prompts that guide AI to generate content-specific outputs. Participants will explore hands-on activities using the C.L.E.A.R. framework: Clarity: Crafting precise prompts that yield useful AI-generated responses. Layout: Structuring AI interactions for different learning objectives (e.g., quizzes, dialogues, essays). Examples: Providing AI with models to enhance the quality of responses. Aim: Defining educational goals to align AI-generated content with learning outcomes. Relevance: Ensuring prompts reflect contextual needs and student engagement strategies. Attendees will practice designing AI prompts for lesson planning, assessment creation, and student engagement, ensuring they leave with practical, classroom-ready applications.",

This session is relevant to 7-12 grade students across all disciplines. The session will provide teachers reading resources, fundamental exercises and building blocks, and essential questions to help create a student philosophy of learning. We will briefly walk attendees through student exercises and processes. Steps: The unit starts with essential questions around learning, teaching, creativity, and thought. We will explore and develop a personal learning theory as a starting point for our work. Students pose and answer fundamental questions about personal learning experiences. Students experiment with LLMs / Generative AI, including creative work with DALL·E, Claude, ChatGPT, etc. Students write and reflect metacognitively on their engagement with Generative AI. To formulate personal understanding, we will read brief excerpts from pedagogical thinker-practitioners such as bell hooks, Paulo Freire, and Seymour Papert about learning theory, child development, and technology. To complement personal understanding, we will use ChatGPT or other LLM to research learning theory by bell hooks, Paulo Freire, and Seymour Papert. We will then engage in a writing prompt/project that brings all components into conversation with one another as a pathway toward a philosophy of life-long learning. This unit challenges students to explore and develop a personal learning theory, and understand more clearly their ownership in their learning process and education.",

    "description": "Educators across disciplines are grappling with how to maintain deep student engagement, foster critical thinking, and teach collaborative problem-solving in an era of generative AI. While AI offers unprecedented access to information and content creation, it also risks reducing learning to passive consumption—especially if used only for speed, efficiency, or automation. The real challenge is: how can we use AI not to replace authentic learning experiences, but to enhance them? This session presents an adaptable framework for using generative AI to design and sustain whole-class simulations—immersive, interdisciplinary experiences that place students at the center of inquiry. These dynamic simulations empower students to act as diplomats, scientists, community leaders, and more, as they grapple with ethical dilemmas, negotiate across differences, and problem-solve real-world challenges. Rather than focusing on specific tools, this session shares a platform-agnostic methodology for: - Structuring simulations around enduring global and civic questions. - Using AI to generate dynamic roles, events, and discussion scaffolds. - Maintaining student-led experiences over multiple days or units. - Embedding reflection and accountability into every phase. Whether you&#x27;re a STEM teacher designing a climate change summit, an ELA teacher running a dystopian society council, or a history teacher simulating peace negotiations, the core strategies can be applied across disciplines, grade levels and environments. Participants will walk through a case study from a global studies simulation, then collaborate in small groups to map out a simulation idea for their own classrooms. They’ll receive guidance on how to create role cards, ethical dilemma prompts, timeline events, and student reflection tools, and walk away with a strong understanding of how to use generative AI to turn their classroom into an entire world, real or fictional. Rooted in constructivist and experiential learning theory, this approach harnesses the potential of AI to support—not supplant—deep learning. By centering student agency, role play, and real-time decision-making, educators can reframe AI as a democratic learning partner. Attendees will leave inspired, equipped, and ready to implement.",

The session will explore cognitive load theory as the learning science principle that underlies most of the work we ask students to do in school, and then ties our use of AI to relevant learning principles, ultimately arriving at a clearer, simpler framework for determining when students should use AI (and when they should not). This session will draw from the presenters’ forthcoming book from Solution Tree on AI and teaching &amp; learning.",

    "description": "Introduction: Teachers work tirelessly to help students use AI productively, ethically, and responsibly. One challenge educators face is not having a practical understanding of AI design, which is usually siloed within the computer science department. But AI design determines how and why AI tools do what they do. In this workshop, participants will design and create their own AI chatbot and the experience can be transformative. Successfully creating a bot solidifies a teacher&#x27;s deep understanding of this technology and better equips them to grow and lead in the classroom and wider school community. Background: This workshop was developed by Reuben Thiessen and Josh Weiss from the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, and aims to “pull back the curtain” of AI by making every participant a designer of their own custom chatbot. Participants will create an AI chatbot that addresses a specific problem important to them or their school community. Teachers will leave the session with a functioning chatbot they can use, modify, and explore with students and colleagues. The Workshop: The Design Your Own Chatbot workshop uses a custom-made block building interface (similar to Scratch) for creating your own chatbot in 60-90 minutes. The experience is available on any platform and is free to use. Each chatbot can be geared to a specific task, subject, or age group. Additionally, the chatbot can be designed to incorporate many educational pedagogies by adding blocks such as Bloom’s Taxonomy, Metacognition or Backwards Design. Given the unique environment of boarding schools, we can discuss how chatbot design impacts our campus AI integration and academic policies in specific ways. The workshop follows this process: Deconstruct - Take apart existing bots to understand how they work Design - Create your own bot based on your specific needs Experiment - Test and refine your creation After the workshop, participants can continue to view or add to the gallery of thousands of chatbots made by educators across the country. Gallery examples can be tested, copied and modified to address any problem or issue. The power of this workshop isn&#x27;t just in the bots created, but in the way one learns to think about AI as a tool that can be shaped to fit unique needs. The deep understanding gained from this experience will expand - and perhaps shift - how one connects with AI moving forward.",

    "description": "The rapid evolution of Generative AI presents K–12 educators with both challenges and opportunities: to grow as professionals, to experiment with new tools, and to help students engage ethically and effectively with emerging technologies. In response to this evolution, we launched a collaborative Gen AI Working Group—an open, cross-disciplinary cohort where educators and staff could do a deep dive on the capabilities and limitations of Gen AI, explore its applications in classroom use, lesson planning, assessment, and administrative tasks, and design interactive workshops to present our findings and engage our colleagues in this learning process. In this session, we will share how we designed and facilitated this working group, the framework we used to structure professional learning using Adult Learning Principles, and what we gleaned from our year-long experiment. We will also offer practical steps and adaptable models to help other schools build similar communities of practice around even changing technology.",

    "description": "The problem: AI has rendered the traditional English essay, if not obsolete, at least highly problematic from an assessment perspective. How can we be sure we are accurately assessing student knowledge and skills if they are outsourcing their thinking to LLMs? How can we convince students that there is value in learning the knowledge and skills if LLMs can instantly create the same products we are asking them to struggle to develop? Adaptable Solutions: The purpose of writing essays is not to produce essays - it is to have students develop critical/analytical thinking, and also to share their conclusions in accessible and engaging ways that reflect a unique voice. To this end, I have been exploring ways for students to turn their critical lens upon the products of LLMs and AI-based search engines themselves, examining issues of construction, authorship, bias, etc, as well as to detect the formulaic nature of LLM products so as to better distinguish their own writing and expression. In a word where everyone has access to AI, how can they make THEIR creative works stand out? Transferability: These lessons could (and do) operate across the humanities and could also have application in any STEM assignment that called for students to assemble and share their ideas and conclusions with others. Theory and Practice: At core these lessons and practices boil down to the principles of Constructivist learning; just telling students \"AI is limited and often dangerous\" and listing all the reasons accomplishes little, especially when the apparent rewards of using it seem so enticing. Instead, students need to experience AI&#x27;s limitations and dangers for themselves, in a guided series of explorations that engage their critical faculties and culminate in the creation of their own unique products.",

    "description": "As generative AI rapidly transforms the educational landscape, many schools are racing to adopt tools without first establishing the culture, mindset, and shared vision needed to integrate them meaningfully. At Greens Farms Academy, we took a different approach. Rather than drafting a rigid policy, we spent the 2023–2024 school year cultivating a community of inquiry, experimentation, and professional trust through a systematic approach. Our focus wasn’t just on upskilling for known tools—it was on pre-skilling our faculty to lead with integrity, curiosity, and adaptability in a time of rapid change. In this session, we will share our journey of building cross-functional teams, running retreats, hosting peer-led workshops, and developing a shared stance on AI that prioritizes ethical use, student safety, and mission alignment. We’ll then invite participants to step inside our Learning Lab experience. Using a structured protocol developed at GFA, participants will engage in a simulated session where they review a proposed classroom AI project, just as our own faculty do. This protocol is more than a vetting process—it’s a collaborative conversation designed to refine ideas, elevate shared values, and build internal capacity for AI leadership.",

    "description": "As generative AI reshapes what students can produce in seconds, educators are being forced to reconsider the academic and intellectual values we’ve built curriculum around. This facilitated group discussion invites all participants to reflect on how we define and assess authenticity, creativity, and critical thinking. What does “authentic work” mean when students can generate fluent writing or polished code with a prompt? How are creative and critical thinking evolving in classrooms where output can be synthetically enhanced or entirely outsourced? Together, we’ll explore how our definitions of originality and skill development can be refocused and how use of AI in the classroom can still foster genuine intellectual growth. Centering our conversation on learning with AI, we’ll talk about how to build assignments and curriculum that can’t be generated, copied, or outsourced–work rooted in a process aimed to strengthen students’ creative and critical thinking abilities.",

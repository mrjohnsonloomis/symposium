    "description": "<p>AI-powered tools offer new possibilities for engaging students in inquiry-based learning across disciplines. This session will explore how educators can use AI to create immersive simulations and investigations that go beyond passive digital interactions. While AI can generate interactive, on-screen experiences—such as historical dialogues, scientific explorations, or real-time problem-solving scenarios—it can also be used to design rich, off-screen activities, including role-playing exercises, structured debates, and hands-on investigative tasks. Drawing from classroom-tested examples of AI-driven historical simulations, this session will demonstrate how these strategies can be adapted for subjects ranging from humanities to STEM. Participants will leave with practical approaches to designing AI-enhanced simulations that foster critical thinking, deepen content understanding, and bring learning to life—both on and off the screen.</p>",

    "description": "<p>AI inspires awe in students—and this first reaction presents one of the greatest challenges for writing instructors of all disciplines. Students are often mesmerized by the instantaneous display of sophisticated vocabulary, rhetorical fluency and encyclopedic knowledge (notwithstanding hallucinations). Programs like ChatGPT can distill complex ideas in syntactically smooth prose while students at all levels, still honing their compositional skills and grappling with new texts and concepts, naturally produce rough ideas with cumbersome phrasing. Comparing AI output with their own drafts, many students express humility and even despondence, with variations of “I could never write anything like that.” Our current educational crisis, therefore, is not simply a matter of combating academic plagiarism but, more fundamentally, of uplifting students’ self-perceptions.</p><p>In my own classes (Grade 12 English Literature), I have used AI writing to help my students become more critical readers of AI, to see through its well-constructed prose and to question the core argument and its use of evidence. Text-based exercises (for example, role-playing, script-doctoring, flipped storytelling) can reveal unpredictable gaps in an LLM’s proficiency at textual reasoning. Students quickly learn to detect uses of textual evidence that are vague, irrelevant, or rote. By positioning students as reviewers and arbiters of AI-generated language, we can help students to recover confidence in their own competencies and analytical thinking. To reframe things more optimistically, the uneven abilities of AI present new opportunities for students to practice the art of close reading and reassert their own expertise.</p>",

Many teachers struggle with vague or ineffective prompts, leading to unreliable AI-generated content that lacks educational value. This session introduces the C.L.E.A.R. Prompt Creator Protocol, a framework designed to help educators craft precise and effective AI prompts. Rather than focusing on specific AI tools, this method ensures that teachers can apply the same structured approach across different platforms—whether using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or school-based AI systems.

While AI offers unprecedented access to information and content creation, it also risks reducing learning to passive consumption—especially if used only for speed, efficiency, or automation. The real challenge is: how can we use AI not to replace authentic learning experiences, but to enhance them?</p><p>This session presents an adaptable framework for using generative AI to design and sustain whole-class simulations—immersive, interdisciplinary experiences that place students at the center of inquiry.

These policies orient conversations around when NOT to use AI rather than when TO use AI.  In this session, participants will explore the development of a new AI Use Framework that is grounded in learning objectives and the creative process.  The session will explore cognitive load theory as the learning science principle that underlies most of the work we ask students to do in school, and then ties our use of AI to relevant learning principles, ultimately arriving at a clearer, simpler framework for determining when students should use AI (and when they should not).</p><p>This session will draw from the presenters’ forthcoming book from Solution Tree on AI and teaching &amp; learning.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Introduction:  Teachers work tirelessly to help students use AI productively, ethically, and responsibly. One challenge educators face is not having a practical understanding of AI design, which is usually siloed within the computer science department. But AI design determines how and why AI tools do what they do. In this workshop, participants will design and create their own AI chatbot and the experience can be transformative. Successfully creating a bot solidifies a teacher&#x27;s deep understanding of this technology and better equips them to grow and lead in the classroom and wider school community.</p><p>Background: This workshop was developed by Reuben Thiessen and Josh Weiss from the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, and aims to “pull back the curtain” of AI by making every participant a designer of their own custom chatbot. Participants will create an AI chatbot that addresses a specific problem important to them or their school community. Teachers will leave the session with a functioning chatbot they can use, modify, and explore with students and colleagues.</p><p>The Workshop: The Design Your Own Chatbot workshop uses a custom-made block building interface (similar to Scratch) for creating your own chatbot in 60-90 minutes. The experience is available on any platform and is free to use. Each chatbot can be geared to a specific task, subject, or age group. Additionally, the chatbot can be designed to incorporate many educational pedagogies by adding blocks such as Bloom’s Taxonomy, Metacognition or Backwards Design. Given the unique environment of boarding schools, we can discuss how chatbot design impacts our campus AI integration and academic policies in specific ways.</p><p>The workshop follows this process: Deconstruct - Take apart existing bots to understand how they work Design - Create your own bot based on your specific needs Experiment - Test and refine your creation</p><p>After the workshop, participants can continue to view or add to the gallery of thousands of chatbots made by educators across the country. Gallery examples can be tested, copied and modified to address any problem or issue. The power of this workshop isn&#x27;t just in the bots created, but in the way one learns to think about AI as a tool that can be shaped to fit unique needs. The deep understanding gained from this experience will expand - and perhaps shift - how one connects with AI moving forward.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The rapid evolution of Generative AI presents K–12 educators with both challenges and opportunities: to grow as professionals, to experiment with new tools, and to help students engage ethically and effectively with emerging technologies. In response to this evolution, we launched a collaborative Gen AI Working Group—an open, cross-disciplinary cohort where educators and staff could do a deep dive on the capabilities and limitations of Gen AI, explore its applications in classroom use, lesson planning, assessment, and administrative tasks, and design interactive workshops to present our findings and engage our colleagues in this learning process.</p><p>In this session, we will share how we designed and facilitated this working group, the framework we used to structure professional learning using Adult Learning Principles, and what we gleaned from our year-long experiment. We will also offer practical steps and adaptable models to help other schools build similar communities of practice around even changing technology.</p>",

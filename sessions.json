    "description": "<p>AI-powered tools offer new possibilities for engaging students in inquiry-based learning across disciplines. This session will explore how educators can use AI to create immersive simulations and investigations that go beyond passive digital interactions. While AI can generate interactive, on-screen experiences—such as historical dialogues, scientific explorations, or real-time problem-solving scenarios—it can also be used to design rich, off-screen activities, including role-playing exercises, structured debates, and hands-on investigative tasks. Drawing from classroom-tested examples of AI-driven historical simulations, this session will demonstrate how these strategies can be adapted for subjects ranging from humanities to STEM. Participants will leave with practical approaches to designing AI-enhanced simulations that foster critical thinking, deepen content understanding, and bring learning to life—both on and off the screen.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Workshop Proposal: Digital Dependency vs. Human Connection: Educational Strategies for the AI Character Era \nProblem Statement\nThe explosive growth of AI character apps presents an urgent risk to adolescents: emotionally manipulative relationships with digital “pals” designed to seem perfectly understanding and always available. These AI relationships create powerful dependencies that directly compete with real human connections, particularly during vulnerable late-night hours in residential settings.\nWorkshop Overview for Strand 2: Human-Centered Innovation\nThis interactive workshop presents a transferable educational model for addressing AI character risks across grades 9-12, offering practical strategies for strengthening human connection as a counterbalance to artificial relationships.\nWorkshop Structure (55 minutes)\nPhase 1: Perfect Friend Illusion (10 minutes)\nSmall group analysis of AI character conversations showing manipulation techniques\nIdentification of specific vulnerabilities in school environments\nSynthesis of key warning signs educators should recognize\nPhase 2: Three-Phase Educational Framework (25 minutes)\nIntroduction Phase: Leveraging residential meetings to expose digital manipulation and dopamine exploitation\nCore Education Phase: Demonstrating effective school-wide presentation strategies with adaptable materials\nProcessing Phase: Implementing small group discussions with grade-specific approaches\nPhase 3: Strengthening Human Connection (20 minutes)\nGrades 9-10: Building structured connection points, guided vulnerability practice, and relationship skills\nGrades 11-12: Developing student leadership, meaningful challenges, and transition preparation\nCreating immediate implementation plans for participants&#x27; schools\nPractical Takeaways\nComplete educational materials ready for immediate implementation\nAge-differentiated connection activities and discussion guides\nFaculty preparation resources requiring no specialized AI knowledge\nAssessment frameworks to measure impact on student behavior\nThis workshop demonstrates how intentional human connection serves as the most effective response to artificial intimacy, providing a model that works across educational contexts while addressing a critical emerging challenge.</p>",

One way to combat this is by deemphasizing student grades and focusing students on their genuine learning. In this presentation, we will look at ways to first create student buy-in to class activities and assessments. Then, we will talk about how systems of &quot;ungrading&quot; can further emphasize student learning and decrease student interest in AI tools. Specific approaches to ungrading will be discussed.</p>",

Student testimonies align with recent research in the neuroscience of happiness, meaning and purpose. Since my article, I have also been writing a new related piece on the role that the philosophy of &quot;human dignity&quot; and Aristotelian ethics can play in articulating how best to acquire AI fluency. Sophisticated and well-articulated framing around AI-use can both earn greater buy-in from both teachers and students but also foster new answers to questions about the value of being human.</p>",

    "description": "<p>AI inspires awe in students—and this first reaction presents one of the greatest challenges for writing instructors of all disciplines. Students are often mesmerized by the instantaneous display of sophisticated vocabulary, rhetorical fluency and encyclopedic knowledge (notwithstanding hallucinations). Programs like ChatGPT can distill complex ideas in syntactically smooth prose while students at all levels, still honing their compositional skills and grappling with new texts and concepts, naturally produce rough ideas with cumbersome phrasing. Comparing AI output with their own drafts, many students express humility and even despondence, with variations of “I could never write anything like that.” Our current educational crisis, therefore, is not simply a matter of combating academic plagiarism but, more fundamentally, of uplifting students’ self-perceptions.</p><p>In my own classes (Grade 12 English Literature), I have used AI writing to help my students become more critical readers of AI, to see through its well-constructed prose and to question the core argument and its use of evidence. Text-based exercises (for example, role-playing, script-doctoring, flipped storytelling) can reveal unpredictable gaps in an LLM’s proficiency at textual reasoning. Students quickly learn to detect uses of textual evidence that are vague, irrelevant, or rote. By positioning students as reviewers and arbiters of AI-generated language, we can help students to recover confidence in their own competencies and analytical thinking. To reframe things more optimistically, the uneven abilities of AI present new opportunities for students to practice the art of close reading and reassert their own expertise.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As AI tools become increasingly integrated into classrooms, educators face a challenge: how to effectively prompt AI to generate meaningful, high-quality responses that support student learning. Many teachers struggle with vague or ineffective prompts, leading to unreliable AI-generated content that lacks educational value. This session introduces the C.L.E.A.R. Prompt Creator Protocol, a framework designed to help educators craft precise and effective AI prompts. Rather than focusing on specific AI tools, this method ensures that teachers can apply the same structured approach across different platforms—whether using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or school-based AI systems. From STEM to humanities, teachers can design prompts that guide AI to generate content-specific outputs.</p><p>Participants will explore hands-on activities using the C.L.E.A.R. framework:\nClarity: Crafting precise prompts that yield useful AI-generated responses.\nLayout: Structuring AI interactions for different learning objectives (e.g., quizzes, dialogues, essays).\nExamples: Providing AI with models to enhance the quality of responses.\nAim: Defining educational goals to align AI-generated content with learning outcomes.\nRelevance: Ensuring prompts reflect contextual needs and student engagement strategies.</p><p>Attendees will practice designing AI prompts for lesson planning, assessment creation, and student engagement, ensuring they leave with practical, classroom-ready applications.</p>",
